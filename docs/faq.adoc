## Common issues

> Ping too high issue

> Why command "wallet_info" response me back: "No balance info available. Is your node running?"

It means that there are no scheduled slots in current cycle.

> "Server error response status: 500 Internal Server Error - 

error selecting draw : ReceiveChannelError("Could not retrieve selection draws: 
Proof of stake cycle unavailable trying to get PoS draw rolls/seed for cycle 4893 thread 0 which is unavailable")"


## Node running
> How to run node in background?

> What ports does the MASSA use?

By default Massa use the port 33033 (TCP/UDP)

> How to restart the Node?

* Ubuntu :  ctrl + c for killing the process and `RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release |& tee logs.txt`
* Windows :  ctrl + c for killing the process and `cargo run --release`
* Mac Os :  ctrl + c for killing the process and `RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release > logs.txt 2>&1`

> How to migrate from one server to another without loosing staked amount and tokens?

You need to backup the file wallet.dat and migrate it in the massa-client folder on your new server


## Balance and wallet
> Why is a balance in the client and in the explorer different?

> Does the command "cargo run -- --wallet wallet.dat" override my existing wallet?

No, it loads the wallet if it exists, otherwise it creates it.

> Where does the wallet.dat placed?

In the massa-client directory


## Rolls and staking

> Do I need to register the keys after subsequent purchases of ROLLs, or do they get stack automatically?

For now they don't stack automatically. In the future we will add a feature allowing "autocompounding". 
That being said, some people appear to have done that very early in the project. 

> Why command "next_draws" shows me an empty line

If you want to see the next block that you will create the command is next_draws <your_address>

> I can buy, send, sell ROLLs and MAS without fee. When should I increase fee >0?

There are only a few transactions at the same time, so most blocks are created empty.
We will communicate if you need to increase the fee.

> I am staking ROLLs but my wallet info doesn't change. When i get my first staking rewards?

You need to wait that your rolls become active (around 8 minutes â†’  3 cycles of 10 periods (one period is 32 blocks = 16 sec)

## Testnet and rewards

> I want to stake more! Can i abuse the faucet bot to get more coins?

You can claim testnet token every 24h, this tokens are wortheless, you won't have advantage on the others by doing that.

> Will amount of staked ROLLs affect Testnet rewards?

No, we will rewards the stability of the node, everyone will have the same amount of token to buy theirs rolls to start at equality. 
We will communicate information later on how we will rank the node stability.
