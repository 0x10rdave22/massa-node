# Massa: The Decentralized and Scaled Blockchain

Massa is a truly decentralized blockchain controlled by thousands of people. 
With the breakthrough multithreaded technology, weâ€™re set for mass adoption.


## Introduction

[Massa](massa.net) is a new blockchain reaching a high transaction throughput in a fully decentralized network, thanks to a parallel block technology. 
Our research is published in this [technical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09029) showing that a throughput of 10'000 transactions per second is reached even in a decentralized network with thousands of nodes.

An easy-to-read blog post introduction is written [here](https://massa.net/blog/post/0/).

We are now releasing the **Massa testnet** in this Gitlab repository, with its explorer available at [test.massa.net](test.massa.net).

In the next months, we will be constantly improving the testnet software, which will lead to bugs and reboots. A stable demo of Massa written in Python is live on [demo.massa.net](demo.massa.net) in the meantime.

## Testnet Incentives

As decentralization is our core value, we would like to help you start and run a Massa node. Running a node during the testnet phase helps us find bugs and improve usability, so it will be rewarded with real Massa on mainnet launch. The mechanics and amounts of those rewards are currently in discussion. 

## Testnet Discussions

Come to our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TnsJQzXkRN) for testnet discussions, in the testnet channel.
We mainly use [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/WbAhso_0YhE4NTg0) for project announcements.
